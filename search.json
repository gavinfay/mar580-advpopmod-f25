    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -&gt; .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert &gt; Citation &gt; DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

    "text": "Distill to quarto\nWe transitioned our events site from distill to quarto in May 2022 (github view before and after). We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Project Build Tools &gt; None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings &gt; Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."

These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action and the gh-pages branch for publishing, separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nIf you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that is preferable to the GitHub file uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos. The uploader does not allow upload of folders, so some manual work would be required.\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file &gt; Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page.

Here is some example text I wrote:\n## Introduction\n\nThis example has some Python code that will be a part of our Quarto site.\n\n\nThird chunk: Code\nNow let’s create a new chunk with the default Code setting.\nPaste the following code (or write some of your own to test):\n#| label: fig-polar\n#| fig-cap: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\nNow, go ahead and execute this code chunk like you normally would, by clicking the cursor in a code block and clicking the sideways “play” triangle to run the selected cells (and advance to the next cell). This code produces a plot.\nNote that the code runs as it normally would; the code options in the comments are just comments.\n\n\nSave your file\nSave your document - I’ll call mine python-example.ipynb in the main repository."

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache."

This takes about 20 minutes. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see Allison Horst’s ESM 206 Google Doc).\n\n\nClone your repo\nYou’ll start by cloning your repository into RStudio.\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git &gt; paste your repository name.\nR for Excel Users: Clone your repository using RStudio has detailed instructions and screenshots of these steps.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nNext, you’ll install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won’t see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio (as well as all other applications on your computer, including the command line).\n\n\nRStudio orientation\nNow let’s take a moment to get oriented. This is an RStudio project, which is indicated in the top-right. The bottom right pane shows all the files in your project; everything we’ve cloned from GitHub. We can open any RStudio project by opening its .Rproj file, or from RStudio File &gt; Open Project ….\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the project name and files pane\n\n\n\n\nVisual Editor\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\nHere’s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have some content formatted in a Google Doc? You can copy-paste it into the Visual Editor and most formatting will be retained.\nThe editing bar provides familiar point and click access to text formatting options like bulleted or numbered lists.\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the point and click editing bar\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe Visual Editor also lets you use many keyboard shortcuts that might be familiar for adding boldface (command-b), italics (command-i), or headers. On a Mac, option-command-2 will make a level 2 header. Try it with option-command-1, or option-command-0 for normal text!\n\n\nInsert an image or figure\nTo insert an image (called a figure in Quarto), click the image icon. This brings up a window in which we can select the image, set its alignment, give it a caption and alt text, hyperlink it, or edit other metadata.\n\n\n\nInsert image or figure using the Visual Editor\n\n\nOnce an image is added, clicking on that image gives us editing options. We can resize it dynamically by clicking in the image and dragging a corner or side to resize. When an image is selected, its dimensions are displayed for editing. Clicking on the gray ellipsis to the right of the dimensions opens the pop-up window to access more metadata edits.\n\n\nInsert a table\nSimilar to adding an image, to insert a table, we click the Table dropdown."

Principles of statistical inference and process-based model building recognizing uncertainty will be outlined. A wide range of population assessment methods will be developed through statistical programming and applied to fisheries and marine mammal data sets to fit complex nonlinear models by estimating values for parameters and associated uncertainty. Programming software for implementing these models, including Template Model Builder and STAN will be used for class labs and assignments for both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation.

Commerce and U.S. Dept. Education 2008 NOAA Tech. Mem. NMFS-F/SPO-91).\n\n\nCourse Objectives:\n\nAbility to apply principles underlying process based model building\nFamiliarity with advanced stock assessment models and their implementation\nExperience in model building and parameter estimation\nUnderstanding of quantitative theories, model diagnostics and results\n\n\n\nNumber of Credits: 3\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nStudents should have taken coursework in applied statistics (e.g. MAR 536) and population dynamics (e.g. MAR 544), or seek permission from the instructors. The Ecological Detective, by Hilborn & Mangel, will serve as a good preparation and perspective on the course topics.\n\n\nStudents are advised to contact the instructor ahead of the course to review their preparation – Dr. Fay will provide reading and review preparation material for self-study over the summer.\n\n\nStudents should be familiar with the statistical programming software R, at an intermediate competency level. The following free resources are excellent refreshers or introductory training material for R:\n\nR for data science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\nSoftware carpentry R lessons: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/\nPosit (formerly RStudio) Education resources\nSwirlstats (learn R in R): https://swirlstats.com/\n\n\n\nRequired Hardware: Class will take place in the SMAST-East computer teaching lab. Individual laptop computers will be required to complete in-class and in-lab exercises and coursework. Pair programming approaches are encouraged during class sessions. Please contact the instructor if the computing requirement creates difficulty for your participation in the course; SMAST laptops may be able to be made available for in-class use. The university library also has laptops available for students to borrow.\n\n\nRequired Software: \nWe will make use of several software packages, but the primary ones you will need:\n\nR (free download at http://r-project.org). Students should also install Rstudio, an integrated development environment for R, free download at posit.co/).\nTemplate Model Builder (see https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki/Download for installation instructions, and troubleshooting).\n\nI will walk through installation and use of TMB and reorient people to the RStudio IDE as part of the software during our first lab session. You should update your version of both R and RStudio for the course (I will distribute the version of R that I shall be using for the course later this summer). If needed, web browser access to R sessions will also be provided through a cloud-based instance of RStudio via posit.cloud. Other IDEs are available (e.g. VS Code, Positron), and you may use the platform of your choice, however because I have to choose something to teach in, I will use RStudio in explanations and examples.\n\n\nCourse Materials: Materials will be distributed through a dedicated course website, and if needed, an RStudio Cloud project. All lectures and labs will be recorded using Zoom.\n \nRemote participation: To facilitate off-campus attendance and engagement in the course, as well as ensuring the course is available and accessible, class sessions will be broadcast via Zoom in addition to in-person meetings. Zoom information can be found at the top of this syllabus and in course emails. A web link to the recordings will be shared so that these are immediately available.\n\n\nTextbook\nWe will be using the Newman et al. (2014) book as a primary source, though this will be supplemented with chapters from other books and from papers, to be distributed and linked to via the course website. The textbook is available in ebook format through the UMass Dartmouth library system.\n\n\nNewman, K. B., Buckland, S. T., Morgan, B. J., King, R., Borchers, D. L., Cole, D.

However, circumstances and events may make it necessary for the instructor to modify the syllabus during the semester and may depend, in part, on the progress, needs, and experiences of the students. Changes to the syllabus will be made in writing with advance notice.\n\n\n\nEvaluation procedures:\n\nFour homework assignments (70%) on advanced population models will be evaluated based on analytical approach, correct solution, and appropriate interpretation. Analytical components of assignments should include submission of complete analytical results (e.g., model scripts and input and output files). Assignments will integrate over course material and expand on the in-class computer exercises. Assignments should be accompanied by a written report (e.g. Rmarkdown or Word document) that provides answers to the assignment questions. Assignments are due before class on the due date. Students can resubmit revised solutions for full credit.\nA small research project (20%) that applies one or more of the methods in class to a relevant dataset or problem. We will discuss possible projects at the start of semester, based on student interests. Ideally, projects will involve small teams of students working collaboratively. Grade will be based on two in-class verbal updates (3 minute presentation) during the semester (5% course grade), and a final verbal project presentation (10% course grade) accompanied by a short written project report (5% course grade) due at the end of the semester.\nParticipation (10%) during class, including engagement in discussions on class readings, and reflection on learning. This includes two self-reflection statements in the middle and at the end of the course asking students to assess their learning. Attendance at the weekly classes and at student hours is the best way to understand topics and assignments.\n\n\n\nClass Policies:\n\nGrades will be reduced for all unexcused late submissions of assignments, with a 10% reduction for each day after the deadline. Requests for extended deadlines will be considered up to one day before the deadline. Unexcused assignments submitted later than three days after the deadline will not be graded. \nFailure to complete any of the requirements for evaluation will result in a score of zero for missing components. At the student’s request, and no more than 48 hours after the final due date for the class, an incomplete grade may be given only in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the instructor. The student must be passing the course at the time of the request or be sufficiently close to passing that the instructor believes that upon completion of the work, the student will pass the course. If the work is not completed within one year of recording the I, the grade will become an F(I).\nThis 3-credit class involves three hours per week of in-class work and an average of six hours per week of out-of-class work is expected.\nUniversity policy on academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, applies (see:  https://www.umassd.edu/studentaffairs/studenthandbook/academic-regulations-and-procedures/).\nElectronic communications about the course will be conducted via email. I will endeavour to respond to emails about the course within 24 hours of your message, though this will be longer at times and also at weekends (for example, emails sent to me on Friday will likely not be replied to until Monday). Plan accordingly. While I may send emails at times that are convenient for me, I do not expect you to respond outside of your usual working hours. As per University policy, students are responsible for all official correspondence sent to their standard UMD e-mail address (@umassd.edu).\nThis course, including student participation, will be recorded on video by the instructor and will be available to students in the course for viewing remotely and after each session. As the Zoom recordings will contain student work, please do not share videos beyond the course attendees without the explicit permission of the instructor. Other course materials will be publicly available online.\nIf you have read this far, please use google search to find a picture of a flightless bird that best reflects your response to coding error messages, and send it to Gavin Fay attached to an email with the subject line “Here is a response to an error message”, worth an extra 5 points on one homework assignment.\nAvailable academic support services are available at: www.umassd.edu/nfi/teaching-and-advising/course-syllabus/sample-disability-statement  \nSMAST Code of Conduct and Diversity statement:https://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/smast/lab-pdf-files/SMAST-Code-of-Conduct-and-Diversity-Statement.pdf\n\n\n\nA full description of Academic Policies associated with this and other UMass Dartmouth courses can be found at: https://www.umassd.edu/provost/resourcesforfaculty/syllabus-language/\n\n\nTitle IX statement: The purpose of a university is to disseminate information, as well as to explore a universe of ideas, to encourage diverse perspectives and robust expression, and to foster the development of critical and analytical thinking skills. In many classes, including this one, students and faculty examine and analyze challenging and controversial topics.\n \nIf a topic covered in this class triggers post-traumatic stress or other emotional distress, please discuss the matter with the professor or seek out confidential resources available from the Counseling Center,http://www.umassd.edu/counselling/, 508-999-8648 or -8650, or the Victim Advocate in the Center for Women, Gender and Sexuality,http://www.umassd.edu/sexualviolence/, 508-910-4584. In an emergency contact the Department of Public Safety at 508-999-9191 24 hrs./day.\n \nUMass Dartmouth, following national guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that faculty follow UMass Dartmouth policy as a “mandated reporter” of any disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, and/or violence shared with the faculty member in person and/or via email. These disclosures include but are not limited to reports of sexual assault, relational abuse, relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While faculty are often able to help students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus, disclosure by the student to the faculty member requires that the faculty member inform the University’s Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at 508-999-8008 to help ensure that the student’s safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student requests that the disclosure not be shared.\nFor confidential counseling support and assistance, please go tohttp://www.umassd.edu/sexualviolence/\n\n\nTechnology Expectations\nI expect that everyone will maintain a classroom conducive to learning. Thus, everyone is expected to behave with basic politeness, civility, and respect for others. In particular, talking in class is okay if it’s part of a class discussion, actively troubleshooting code during lab exercises, or with me. Private communications are not permitted. Neither are reading extraneous materials, using electronic equipment off task, or sleeping. Technology is allowed to aid in learning and understanding material. However, please do not use a personal device for any purpose unrelated to our class. All devices should be silenced. Cell phones should be put away when they are not being used for class activities (e.g. taking pictures of work, recording eachother giving practice talks, etc.). If you need to take a call or text during class please step outside. Suggestions for improvement on the class technology policy are welcome at any time. Any concern about the course should be brought first to my attention.\n\n\nAI, LLMs, and BS (credit toAndrew Heiss)\nAI tools are fast changing the landscape when it comes to work. This is especially true for coding, many software are embedding AI into them to assist users produce work and learn. While there is a relatively large component of the class related to scientific programming, we are doing this to support our statistical learning – the key objectives in the course are learning about and how to apply and evaluate statistical methods, not just the computer code to implement them. I highly recommend not using AI tools such as large language models (LLMs) for generating your writing in this class. I am not opposed to LLMs in many situations. For myself, I am beginning to useGitHub Copilot for computer programming-related tasks, most often to assist with tasks I already know how to do, or are similar problems to something I have done before. Like many of you, I have also used ChatGPT to create code that I can then inspect and validate. Chances are if I write this next year my use cases will have increased. What we do know is that using LLMs requires careful skill and attention and practice. I REALLY like Jenny Bryan’s thoughts on using LLMs to ‘vibe code’ (sidenote: Asking yourself “What Would Jenny Bryan Do?” is a pretty good lifehack when it comes to data science in my view). Google Docs and Microsoft Word now have built-in text-generation tools where you can start writing a sentence and let the machine take over the rest. ChatGPT and other services let you generate multi-paragraph essays with plausible-looking text. I encourage you to please not use these for writing. There’s a reason most university classes require some sort of writing, like reading reflections, essay questions, and research papers.The process of writing is actually the process of thinking:\nWriting is hard because the process of getting something onto the page helps us figure out what we think—about a topic, a problem or an idea. If we turn to AI to do the writing, we’re not going to be doing the thinking either. That may not matter if you’re writing an email to set up a meeting, but it will matter if you’re writing a business plan, a policy statement or a court case. (Rosenzweig 2023)\nUsing LLMs and AI to generate this writing will not help you think through the materials. You can create text and meet the suggested word count and finish the assignment, but the text will be meaningless. There’s an official philosophical term for this kind of writing:bullshit (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater 2024;Frankfurt 2005). Philosophical bullshit is “speech or text produced without concern for its truth” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater 2024). Bullshit isn’t truth, but it’s also not lies (i.e. the opposite of truth). LLMs and AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and so on are bullshit machines. That might sound hyperbolic, but at a technological level, that’s literally what they do. Do not replace the important work of writing your thoughts, perspectives, and critique with AI bullshit. Remember that the point of writing is to help crystallize your thinking. Chugging out words that make it look like you read and understand the content will not help you learn. In your project report, I want to see good engagement with the analyses that you have performed and your research questions. I want to see your thinking process. I want to see your personal insights about your work and its importance. I don’t want to see a bunch of words that look like a human wrote them. That’s not useful for future you. That’s not useful for me. \nI will not spend time trying to guess if your assignments are AI-generated. If you do turn in AI-produced content, I won’t automatically give you a zero. I’ll grade your work based on its own merits. Remember that text generated by these platforms is philosophical bullshit. Since it has nothing to do with truth, it will not—by definition—earn good grades.\n\n\nPrimary & Suggested Reading\nMore readings will be added to the course website.
